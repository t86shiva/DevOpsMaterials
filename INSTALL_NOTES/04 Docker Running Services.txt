### So you want to run a container with Apache2 (or some service running) 
# So you do the following
#      docker run -d <yourimage> and set the entry point to service apache2 start
#      Ouch... Now your apache2 (or service) does run but will never be accessible why?? 
# To make theses available, instead use /usr/sbin/apache2 -D FOREGROUND 
# now as long as apache2 does not die, your container will be alive. 
# examples: 
#/usr/sbin/apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND
#/usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND
# Side note: installing Apache2/HTTP is as simple as 
#apt-get install -y apache2
#yum install -y httpd
# from an interactive container, typing exit or control-C or control-\ will 
# cause container to exit. To avoid this and still come out, type control-P Control-Q
